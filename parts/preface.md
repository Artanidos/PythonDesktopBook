##Motivation

After coding for over 30 years now, I came from C, Assembler, Clipper, Powerbuilder, Java, C#, Objetive-C, C++ to Python. And guess what...   
**I love Python**   
It would be easy for me to develop native apps using Java, C++ or Objective-C and I am also able to learn Kotlin, Dart or Swift, but things are much easier when you just use Python. 
I have done a Django tutorial which is a web framework and the ease they have build a model class to be stored in an SQL server has stunned me. I just had to write a model class with a few line of code, then I had to run a scaffolding job which creates corresponding tables on the SQL server and after that I could run the Python interpreter, import my model class, write some properties and save the instance. 
No SQL coding at all. I have been hooked :-) 
Then I learned about generators, comprehension and meta programming and Python got me. 

Btw...to be able to write this book I wrote an application called EbookCreator. This app is also using PyQt5, QtWigets and I am using QML to serialize book projects, it is open source and you may have a look at the source code for inspiration. You are able to find the <a href="https://github.com/Artanidos/EbookCreator/">sources</a> on github.

##Who This Book Is For

If you are able to write basic Python code and you are interested in developing apps with user interfaces for multiple platforms in Python this book is right for you. 
This book does not assume that you are familiar with Qt. 
If you want, try out all of the examples in this book it would be a great benefit if you are also working on a Linux machine like me, but MacOS and Windows should also be ok if your are able to search for help in the internet for OS specific differences. 

##Who This Book Is Not For

If you are new to Python and programming you should consider reading beginner books for Python and watch tutorials on Youtube before continuing to read this book. 
I am not going into Python specific details in this book. 

##How This Book Is Organized

Here are the main topics in each part of the book. 
First in ***Part I*** you are going to install all necessary software to be able to build applications with PyQt5 and Python.
In ***Part II*** you will learn about two different approaches to build apps. 
In ***Part III*** you will learn to code apps using QtWigets.   
In ***Part IV*** you will learn to create a line of business application using a database to store data.
And in ***Part V*** you will learn to create a setup program which you can deploy to a Linux device.

##Acknowledgements

I am very thankful to Guido van Rossum for inventing Python in 1991.

I am also very thankful to all Pythonistas out there who are creating tutorials and videos on YouTube where one is able to learn Python for free.
